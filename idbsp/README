First, the sources say this programs come with a README, the archive I got
included sources only and no README or any other documentation, so this was
written completely by me (Udo Munk).

Then the programs had some bugs, an integer is not a long and printf()/scanf()
aren't happy if one uses format %d and then passes a long, fixed.
There were plenty of warnings, unused variables, comments inside comments and
stuff like this, fixed.

Then both programs only were usable for Doom WAD files, I added support for
Doom][ WAD files.

Then idbsp aligned things on a 16 pixel grid, which made it almost useless.
I modified that, so that it matches the other tools in this collection,
things can be positioned anywhere with tkwadcad and don't need to be on a
grid. As far as I know every WAD editor allows to position things anywhere.

If one runs idbsp it refers to the included README for terms of use and
distribution. As explained above, there was no README in the archive.
The source file idbsp.c says that the programs use and distribution is
permitted according to the terms of the GNU General Public License. I have
downloaded the original id Software Objective-C code and compared it with
this stuff. Without doubt the same algorithms are used, idbsp is a port
from Objective-C to ANSI C of the original id sources. The sources
released by id didn't include any copyright or other terms of usage and
distribution. I'm not certain, that sources for this idbsp port really
are under GPL, because it seems to be id's property, algorithm wise. So,
if in doubt consult a legal eagle or ask id, whatever.

I guess the program waddwd was written from scratch, the source file
says use and distribution of the code is permitted to the terms of the
GNU General Public License, included in the doc directory.

More work done July/August 1999, Udo Munk (munkudo@aol.com):

	- the sources looked like anyone rolled an armadillo over a keyboard,
	  the poor thing got awful sick from that and puked all over the
	  sources. I do not enjoy reading code like that, reformatted so that
	  a C programmer who read one or both of the bibles will recognize this
	  as C source code.
	- deleted the Objective-C fragments left from those who ported it to
	  ANSI C. The Objective-C code was not very helpful for understanding
	  the code, and in case anyone wishes to reference it, the original
	  sources released by id still are available on their Internet server.
	- hum, if programs run into errors the main function does not return
	  0, it returs a value different from 0. That is so, so that one can
	  catch errors in shell scripts running programs, fixed.
	- endian support was commented out by others before, sigh. Fixed so
	  that idbsp should be usable on big endian systems too. Removed the
	  local endian support routines and used the ones from the lib.
	- added support so that idbsp can read map file in Doom format
	  directely.
	- added support for map files in extended Hexen format.
        - added support for Hexen BEHAVIOR resource.
	- added option to suppress splitting of lines.
	- added quiet option.
	- raised version number to 2.0.0, to many modifications done for
	  still calling it 1.something.
	- renamed wad_dwd to waddwd, more comfortable to type.
