This is DMPSMU, the DOOM PostScript Maps Utility package. It provides DMPSMU,
an interactive utility to generate PostScript maps of levels in DOOM, DOOM ][,
Ultimate DOOM and Heretic, the 3D action games by id Software and Raven
Software, and DMPSMAP, a command-line based sidekick.  They offer everything
you ever wanted from a DOOM map generator, and more!  The following features
are presented:

* detailed control over layout and appearance of the page(s):
  Supports European/American paper sizes, Portrait/Landscape orientation,
  printing of a border, the level name (possibly user defined) and a legend
  box, and auto scaling depending on the size and orientation of the map
  versus the paper size as well as the map's shape versus the presence of
  level name and/or legend box.

* multi-page capability, printing on 2 or 4 normal pages:
  Creates one PostScript file in A4/A3/A2 or Letter/Tabloid/double_Tabloid
  size, from which individual A4/Letter size pages can be printed using
  shell script utilities.

* detailed control over which Things will be printed:
  Distinguishes between starting points, teleport exits, small bonuses,
  weapons, enhancements, enemies, barrels and decorations, as well as
  their multi-player and difficulty-setting properties.

* fading LineDefs that are secret or part of a secret Sector:
  Prints grey lines for secret LineDefs or LineDefs belonging to a secret
  Sector. For really seeing where the secrets are, the following feature
  is even better though.

* shading secret and damage Sector areas, but not their inner Sectors:
  Prints grey areas for secret and damage Sectors but excludes any inner
  Sectors like massive pillars. Truly visualizes where you must have been
  to get a 100% Secret score, and which areas you'd rather avoid.

* linking teleporters and their exits by faint lines:
  Shows where you're teleported by linking the midpoint of a teleporting
  LineDef to the corresponding teleport exit. Now you never have to feel
  tele-lost again!

* support for DOOM, DOOM ][, Ultimate DOOM & Heretic WAD files:
  Recognizes all level numbering schemes, level names, things, monsters and
  monster-only teleporters.

You have extensive control over which features are used when printing your
maps by setting and clearing one or more of 16 print flags, boosting a
staggering 48K (no, not 64K ;) possibilities in outputting your maps!  Which
is a meaningless number as in practice you will need to use only a few flags,
because most flags are set to defaults which you'll like to use all the time.

In addition, since the interactive utility DMPSMU is derived from DEU, the
Doom Editor Utility, and retains from this tool all functions that have a
read-only effect on the DOOM/Heretic WAD files, it offers examination but not
modification of these files under Unix and has a new function to display a
level's vital statistics.

INSTALLATION
============

Installation of the package is straight-forward. Unzip the package (which
you have probably done already to read this file ;)  preferably recursively
(default in Info-UNZIP, requires '-d' option to PKUNZIP). Go into the source
directory and check the Makefile for the C compiler and its flag and include
definitions. Set CC to your ANSI C compiler, CFLAGS & LDFLAGS as desired and
if necessary, INCLUDES to your directory with ANSI C header files. If you're
on a big endian system, leave DEFINES as is, otherwise select the empty one.
Then type 'make'.

Find a way to copy your DOOM{1,2}.WAD/HERETIC{1}.WAD file to your Unix system
and copy the shell scripts 'all*.sh' and 'dmps*.sh' as well as the just 'made'
executables into the same directory for easy access to the WAD file.  And
presto, you're all set to _truly_ paper the wall with DOOM/Heretic PostScript
Maps! :-)


MAP ORIENTATION
===============

The following DOOM levels are best printed in Portrait:
  E1M8, E2M2, E2M6, E2M8, E3M1, E3M2, E3M6, E3M7, E3M8, E3M9
The remaining DOOM levels are best printed in Landscape:
  E1M1, E1M2, E1M3, E1M4, E1M5, E1M6, E1M7, E1M9,
  E2M1, E2M3, E2M4, E2M5, E2M7, E2M9, E3M3, E3M4, E3M5
The scripts 'allmap.sh/bat' print these maps accordingly.

The following Ultimate DOOM levels are best printed in Portrait:
  E4M2, E4M7, E4M8, E4M9
The remaining Ultimate DOOM levels are best printed in Landscape:
  E4M1, E4M3, E4M4, E4M5, E4M6
The scripts 'allmapu.sh/bat' print these maps accordingly.

The following DOOM ][ levels are best printed in Portrait:
  MAP01, MAP02, MAP10, MAP12, MAP13, MAP15, MAP16, MAP17, MAP19,
  MAP20, MAP23, MAP25, MAP27, MAP28, MAP30, MAP32
The remaining DOOM ][ levels are best printed in Landscape:
  MAP03, MAP04, MAP05, MAP06, MAP07, MAP08, MAP09, MAP11, MAP14,
  MAP18, MAP21, MAP22, MAP24, MAP26, MAP29, MAP31
The scripts 'allmap2.sh/bat' print these maps accordingly.

The following Heretic levels are best printed in Portrait:
  E1M3, E1M5, E1M7, E1M8, E1M9, E2M3, E2M5, E2M6, E2M7, E2M9,
  E3M1, E3M2, E3M3, E3M5, E3M6, E3M7, E3M8, E3M9
The remaining Heretic levels are best printed in Landscape:
  E1M1, E1M2, E1M4, E1M6, E2M1, E2M2, E2M4, E2M8, E3M4, E4M1
The scripts 'allmaph.sh/bat' print these maps accordingly.


RANDOM NOTES
============

Anyone know the proper name for double_Tabloid?  Please email me.
Anyone know a more complete list of big/little endian systems? Ditto.
The same goes for ideas for new features and other improvements.

If you want different default settings for the print flags, then change them
in 'source/print.c' and remake.

Best results are of course produced by printing the PostScript files on a
better than 300 dpi printer <duh;>


KNOWN PROBLEMS
==============

- secret sectors enclosed by damage sectors, or vice versa, may or may not
  have their inner sector shaded correctly, depending on the order of the
  sectors in the sector list, eg. DOOM ][ MAP24 sectors 62 & 63


TODO
====

- better thing icons, or thing labelling
- maybe some way to link trigger linedefs (switches, etc.) to the sectors
  they operate on, without cluttering up the map?
- merging command-line operation (dmpsmap) into the main utility (dmpsmu)


CREDITS
=======

My thanks go to the following people for their work:

- the folks at id Software for creating such a fabulous game!

- Brendon J. Wyber <b.wyber@csc.canterbury.ac.nz> and Raphaël Quinet
  <quinet@montefiore.ulg.ac.be> (and everyone working with them) for
  creating the DEU editor and Per Allansson <c91peral@und.ida.liu.se> and
  Per Kofod <per@ollie.dnk.hp.com> for porting it to a sane C compiler ;)
  And: if they hadn't released the source with it, this utility wouldn't
  exist (or at least not in the same form :-)

- Matt Fell <msfell@aol.com> for the indispensable DOOM Specs, especially
  for the v1.666 preview!

- James Bonfield <jkb@mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk> for showing (in his early v1.1 hack
  at this PostScript thingy) how to solve the big/little endian problem.

- for supplying compilation info for the Makefile:
  Hans Peter Verne <h.p.verne@kjemi.uio.no> on Ultrix4.3/DECstation
  Michael J. Salay <salay_mike@ae.ge.com> on HP-UX 9.0/HP710 station
  Uwe Girlich <girlich@aix520.informatik.uni-leipzig.de> for DJGPP/GO32 help


RESTRICTIONS
============

  The source in the DMPSMU package should not be used to create a utility
  that can modify the main WAD files; you're better off with DEU v5.21 GCC
  anyway. It is illegal to use the source in this package to modify the
  shareware versions of DOOM and Heretic.

  If you derive another utility from this package, name it something else
  and give some credit to the original author(s).

  If you distribute the DMPSMU package, please distribute the original ZIP
  file unmodified and under the same name.
