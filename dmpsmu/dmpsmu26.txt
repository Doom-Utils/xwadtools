DMPSMU: DooM PostScript Maps Utility v2.6
=========================================

DESCRIPTION:
        DMPSMU is an interactive utility on Unix and DOS (source code
included) to generate PostScript maps of levels in DOOM, DOOM ][,
Ultimate DOOM and Heretic.  It offers several advanced features:
    - detailed control over layout and appearance of the page(s)
    - multi-page capability, printing on 2 or 4 normal pages
    - detailed control over which Things will be printed
    - fading LineDefs that are secret or part of a secret Sector
    - shading secret Sector areas, but not their inner Sectors
    - linking teleporters and their exits by faint lines
It is derived from DEU, the Doom Editor Utility and retains from this tool
all functions that have a read-only effect on the main WAD files, thus
allowing examination but not modification of these files under Unix, and it
has a new function to display a level's vital statistics.  A command-line
based utility DMPSMAP with only the map printing function is also included.

CHANGES from v2.0:
	This release adds DOS executables, fixes teleport linking problems,
adds damage Sector shading, fixes various shading problems with oddly
shaped sectors, adds Ultimate DOOM and Heretic support, and includes other
minor changes.
