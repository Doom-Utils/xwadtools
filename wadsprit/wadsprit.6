.SH DISCLAIMER
This program is furnished on an AS IS basis for the fun of it.
id Software, Raven Software and Activision do not support this program.

.SH DESCRIPTION
The program takes a WAD file (either IWAD or PWAD) as input, and decompiles
all sprites used for monsters, weapons, explosions and so on found between
the S_START and S_END markers into ppm graphic files.
.P
A sprite named \fBFRED\fP would be saved as \fB./sprites/fred.ppm\fP.
If the \fB./sprites\fP directory does not already exist, it is created.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-p
Preserve case. Prevent the name of the graphic files to be forced to
lower case. For example, a sprite named \fBFRED\fP would be saved as
.B ./sprites/FRED.ppm
.TP
\fB\-c\fR \fIpalette\fR
By default the program uses the Doom palette for the color table lookup.
With this option another palette can be used, \fIpalette\fR can be \fIdoom\fR,
\fIheretic\fR, \fIhexen\fR or \fIstrife\fR.

.SH BUGS/ERRORS
Microsoft OS's can't write files with a \\ in the filename and some
sprites in id's IWAD's have them in the name. For now the program just
will count the number of files it can't create and go on.
