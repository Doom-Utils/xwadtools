Nah, I sure would mess this up and miss someone who put endless
work into some of the stuff. The documentation for the tools
mention, who wrote them and contributed to them, the manual pages
have AUTHOR sections, please read them.

The whole WAD tools collection was assembled by Udo Munk, so
if something is broken it might be my fault and not the fault
of the original authors.

If someone who worked on this is not mentioned in the manual pages
then please email me, so that I can correct this.
