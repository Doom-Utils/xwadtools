DMTXLS: DooM TeXtures LiSter v1.1
=================================

DESCRIPTION:
        DMTXLS is a command-line utility on Unix and DOS (source code
included) to generate cross-reference lists of the wall textures and flats
used in levels in DOOM, DOOM ][, Ultimate DOOM & Heretic.  The lists
include the number of times each texture is used, in verbose mode the
SideDef/Sector numbers where they are used, and in verbose-line mode the
LineDefs corresponding to those SideDefs as well.  It's a handy little
tool for PWAD developers, especially when applying custom textures.

It is derived from DMPSMU/DMPSMAP, which is in turn derived from DEU,
the Doom Editor Utility.

CHANGES FROM v1.0:
        This release adds Ultimate DOOM support.
