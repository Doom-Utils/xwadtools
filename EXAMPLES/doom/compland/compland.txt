Description            : A test level which shows what I can do with xwadtools.
			 Scenery is a hightech environment and there are some
			 fun fights (maybe). Ammo and weapons are not laying
			 on the streets to be picked up by kids and play with,
			 you need to look for it and get it from your enemy too.
			 Also health is spare, better avoid getting shot too
			 much and don't run around without Kevlar vest, there
			 are some ugly creatures outside of the lab.
			 All secrets are marked and can be found if you look
			 arround, if you race the map you might miss some.
			 Proceed carefully and watch your step, as always, and
			 usually it's better to run than to die.

Additional Credits to  : id Software, anyone who programmed and contributed to
			 the tools included in xwadtools, anyone who
			 contributed to XDoom, my engine of choice of course,
			 Kurt Kesler for the animated computer textures,
			 Joe Zona for the plant sprites.

* Play Information *

Game                    : DOOM II

Deathmatch 2-4 Player   : Deathmatch starts are provided but not tested
Difficulty Settings     : Yes

New Sounds              : No

New Graphics            : The rock textures in Doom IWAD files are not
			  very good, Hexen has some better looking ones.
			  The rock textures were extracted from the Hexen
			  IWAD and color quantized for Doom with tools
			  included in xwadtools and netpbm, mkqmap(6) and
			  ppmquant(1).
			  The animated computer textures were borrowed from
			  Kurt Kesler's ZDoom WAD KZDoom1, have a look at
			  http://www.fidnet.com/~kesler.
			  I threw out the yuckie Doom plants and decorated
			  the level with some nice and realistic looking
			  plants borrowed from Joe Zona's Doom2 REAL
			  Conversion.
			  The marble texture and flat was rendered with
			  Povray3.

* Construction *

Base                    : New level from scratch

Editor(s) used          : tkwadcad and vi, wadlc, the level was build under
			  UNIX. I prefer to use IDBSP as the node builder,
			  what was good enough for id sure will do for me.
			  I have tested it with BSP too and it works OK.
			  A build with Warm 1.6 also works OK now, the known
			  problem in versions before is fixed.

Build time              : A while.
                          
Known Bugs              : There are 2 minor misaligned textures you probably
			  won't notice.
			  This PWAD won't play with Doom][ or Doom95 as is
			  because it includes flats and sprites. To make it
			  playable with the original game engines merging
			  with the IWAD is required with DeuSF or DeuTEX.
			  Not necessary to do this for playing with bug fixed
			  engines like Boom, XDoom or ZDoom.

You may do whatever you want with the level map. Some graphics were taken
from other WAD projects, their authors allow to do this if credit is given.
The rock textures are converted textures from the Hexen WAD and belong Raven
Software. Maybe I'm violating a copyright here, but I'm to lazy to draw such
nice rock textures my self ;-)
