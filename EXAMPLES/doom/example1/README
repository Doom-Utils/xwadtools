This was the very first Doom PWAD I got done completely under UNIX, after
I had wadlc and a node builder working and so I wanted to preserve it. At
the time when I got this working there was no level editor available for
UNIX, so I wrote the map with the vi text editor. This can be done, but
it eventually convinced me to get busy writing a level editor for UNIX.
The level uses stuff only, which is available in Doom and Doom][ and the
PWAD file plays with both, because it includes E1M1 and MAP01. Have a look
at the Makefile to see, how building such a PWAD can be automated.
