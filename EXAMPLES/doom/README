Besides the examples in this directory you might want to have a look at XDoom
too, if you are using a UNIX system. The XDoom engine has some new features
implemented over the sources id released and the distribution includes example
PWAD's, which demonstrate this features. This examples include all the sources
to rebuild the PWADs self with xwadtools, so even if you favor another Doom
engine and are not interested in the XDoom features, you might be able to learn
something from the examples included there.

XDoom is available at ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/pub/doom/source/xdoom* and mirrors
like http://www.doomworld.com.
