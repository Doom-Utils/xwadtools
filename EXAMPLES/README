This directory contains example PWAD's for the WAD based games, which were
build with this tools collection. This examples are an addendum to the
documentation for the tools. It is a good idea to study the makefiles in
the directories and explore, how the tools are used to assemble PWAD's
from various different resources.

To build the PWAD's your self you enter the directory with the example
and you type 'make'. If you try this under Windows 9x/NT you need to do
this from a Cygwin shell, not from a MS DOS box. With 'make clean' you
clean up the directory from all temporary generated files, just leaving
the sources needed to build the PWAD and the playable PWAD it self.
After that you could start modifying the resources for an example to your
taste and re-build it with make like described above.

Right now there are just a few examples and they are for Doom/Doom2 and
Hexen only. I do not have the registered versions of Heretic and Strife,
so there are no examples for those games yet.
