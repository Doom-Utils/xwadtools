A small Hexen level, used to test out the capabilities of xwadtools for
building Hexen levels. Don't expect much from this level yet, it is tiny
and not great fun to play. But it shows how to use ACS scripts and linedef
specials for building traps and it has a working Polyobj door. Textures
might not be properly aligned, I'll keep working on it as time permits.
Feel free to mess with this level in any way you wish, I release it in the
hope that it shows how to make Hexen levels with xwadtools.

Are the bats bothering you? Hammer at the wall at the cave they come from,
that will spook the little buggers. Then again, spooking some harmless bats
might not be that a great idea...

The story so far...
The other day you annoyed a very powerful mage too much and he used a
teleportation spell on you. He teleported you to some place on the planet
NOWHERE you'd ever been before. Your goal is to find the way back to the
action and maybe take revenge.
Better don't assume he teleported you to a nice place, he was real pissed
when he casted the spell...
