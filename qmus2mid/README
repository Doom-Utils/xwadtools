This README covers the unix version of qmus2mid. 

QMUS2MID is a program for converting MUS-files to MIDI files.
It is originally written by Sebastien Bacquet (bacquet@iie.cnam.fr) 
for DOS (gcc), and has been ported to Unix by Hans Peter Verne 
(hpv@kjemi.uio.no).  The command line syntax is somewhat simplified 
in the unix-version, but the versions are otherwise identical.

Qmus2mid is tested on i386-linux, dec-alpha-osf1 and dec-mips-ultrix, 
and of course MSDOS (the DOS executable hung the machine when I tried 
it :-). Currently, the program does not work on Big-Endian machines. 

To compile, do

  gcc -O3 -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -ansi -pedantic -o qmus2mid qmus2mid.c

or simply

  cc -o qmus2mid qmus2mid.c

and drop the binary in a suitable directory, such as /usr/local/bin/. 
Put the man-page qmus2mid.1 in a corresponding man directory, such as
/usr/local/man/man1/.  Don't forget to read it!

You can still compile it under dos, you would then probably want to
#define MSDOG  somewhere (gcc -DMSDOG qmus2mid.c should do), to include
the features in the DOS-version.

QMUS2MID is (C) 1995,96 Sebastien Bacquet, and is released under the 
GNU General Public License, see the file COPYING for details.
