Xew - X Examine WAD version 1.08
================================

Xew is a program to examine and extract the images and sounds of a
DOOM-like WAD-file (doom, doom2, heretic, hexen, strife; IWADs or PWADs).
This is a Unix version with an X/Forms interface of the original DOS
program ew.  The DOS version as well as text-only (n)curses version can
also be compiled.  Xew is no WAD editor, it is simply an easy way to
examine and grab the sounds and images for use as icons, xmailbox fanfares
etc.

An i386-Linux/ELF statically linked executable is included.  Recompiling is
recomended all the same, for speed and size.  To compile, the XForms
library is needed, see http://bragg.phys.uwm.edu/xforms/.
