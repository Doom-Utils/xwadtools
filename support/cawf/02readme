This sources are modified to make it working under Windows 9x/NT
with the Cygwin tools.

The library path is modified to c:\lib\cawflib and the TERM environment
variable is not used anymore, to figure which device type to use. There
is support for dumb.dev included only anyway and under Cygwin bash $TERM
is set to cygwin. Instead of hacking new device files we just use the
provided dumb one, good enough.
