# This is the list of WAD engines which can be executed directly from
# tkwadcad. The list needs a name for the menu and a Bourne shell script
# which runs the selected engine. Use the provided examples to add
# your favorite engine to the editor, if it's not included already.
# Or just throw out the engines you don't use, they will not be in the
# option menu then.
