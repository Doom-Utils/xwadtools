There is no installation program for this yet, so you need to do it by hand.

The executable program is tkwadcad, copy this into the directory with your
local installed programs, /usr/local/bin under UNIX, c:\bin under Windows.

The data files must be installed in a local lib directory, under UNIX
use /usr/local/lib/tkwadcad, this can be a symbolic link too. Under
Windows use c:\lib\tkwadcad.
Now you need to copy the directories scripts, lib and the file engines.lst
into this lib directory. Depending on the game engines you want to edit
level maps for, you need to copy the directories doom, doom2, xdoom, xdoomplus
and hexen too.
If the lib directory is not /usr/local/lib/tkwadcad or c:\lib\tkwadcad,
you must modify the line with this string in your tkwadcad executable to
match the directory you choosed for the data files.

Under Win9x/NT you also need to rename the wish executable for using the
one included in Cygwin:

#!/bin/sh
# the next line restarts using wish \
exec cygwish80 "$0" "$@"
...

With this done it runs like under UNIX too, open a Cygwin bash shell
and type 'tkwadcad your_map_file'. With option -debug under Windows
the console will be visible. I use this for debugging under Windows,
'puts' output goes into the console and not into the terminal window
as under UNIX.

If you want to see the wall textures and floor/ceiling flat graphics
and sprite graphics in the editor, you need to extract them from your
IWAD files first.

For Doom do this:
cd /usr/local/lib/tkwadcad/doom
wadtex -t /path_to_your_iwad_files/doom.wad
wadflat /path_to_your_iwad_files/doom.wad
wadsprit /path_to_your_iwad_files/doom.wad

Of course you can use the IWAD from Ultimate Doom too. The shareware Doom
doesn't include all image resources, so it cannot be used for this. Besides
that it isn't possible to load PWADs with the shareware version anyway.

For Doom2:
cd /usr/local/lib/tkwadcad/doom2
wadtex -t /path_to_your_iwad_files/doom2.wad
wadflat /path_to_your_iwad_files/doom2.wad
wadsprit /path_to_your_iwad_files/doom2.wad

I think you can use one of the IWAD's from Final Doom too, but I haven't
tested this, there might be differences, dunno, try it.

For the other supported games do the same as above, extract the graphics
resources from the IWAD you intend to use into /usr/local/lib/tkwadcad/xdoom
as an example. Of course it can be a symbolic link under UNIX too, which
points to the Doom or Doom][ resource directory, so that the graphics use up
disk space only once.
For other games than Doom, like Hexen and Heretic, do not forget to use
option -c hexen or so with the graphics extract tools, else the colors
will be all wrong, because all graphic tools assume the Doom palette as
the default.

Extracting the graphics data needs to be done once, if you have them
already, just install the new program and data files in place. The graphics
in PPM image format will take up a lot of disk space, you don't have to
extract them, the editor will work without, just not showing any images
then. If you have extracted images with tools from an release before
11-Feb-1999, you should export the images again, because the older version
used a wrong color palette.
Also with this release tkwadcad will find the graphic files only, if they are
all lower case. So if you had them exported before with upper case you need
to change the filenames to lower case, or just extract them again without
option -p for the tools.

Have a look at the  scripts /usr/local/lib/tkwadcad/scripts/wadrun_*.sh.
The pathnames for the WAD engines in this scripts are from my systems,
you need to adjust them for your systems, if you want to run a engine from
the editor directly.

The file /usr/local/lib/tkwadcad/engines.lst includes the WAD engines
you can choose from tkwadcad to run a map with. This is an example,
edit it to fit your needs. Under Win9x the id Doom, id Doom 2 and
Boom engines are supported, but it won't work to run them from tkwadcad,
the engines get stuck. I don't know why, use Doom95, ZDoom or glDoom, that
works.
