1.0 Introduction
----------------
    REJECT.EXE is a command line based utility used for building the 
    REJECT resource in a DOOM or DOOM 2 PWAD file. It post-processes a 
    PWAD which has been created using a level editor such as DEU. Its main 
    purpose is to speed up slow PWAD files by reducing the number of 
    line-of-sight calculations performed by the DOOM engine. 

    REJECT.EXE is freeware.

3.0 Support
-----------
    
    I can be contacted by email at the above address. All the information 
    required to run and operate REJECT should be provided in this document. 
    Before using REJECT:
                       ********************* 
                        READ THIS DOCUMENT!
                       ********************* 

    My spare time is limited so I will not respond to any queries if 
    the answer is to be found in this document. However I would be glad 
    to here from anyone who thinks they have found a bug in REJECT or 
    has any ideas on how to improve REJECT. 

    The source to REJECT is provided in the file SOURCE.ZIP you are free
    to use all or part of the source in your own programs, however if you
    do I would be grateful if you would credit me in some way. 

    If you create a enhanced version of REJECT from the source provided
    I would be grateful if you would send the modified source to me so
    I can put the enhancements into the 'official' version. 
 
    I will not support any versions of REJECT other than those built by
    myself.

    Please _DO_NOT_ send me any large binary files (such as your latest 
    PWAD) as email without my prior consent. My time on the net is limited
    as I have to call long distance to my Internet Access provider and my
    phone bill is large enough already.


4.0 Requirements
----------------

    REJECT is a 32 bit DOS extended program built with SYMANTEC C++ v6.11.
    Any machine which is capable of running DOOM will (should :->) be capable
    of running REJECT.

5.0 Usage
---------
        
    REJECT is run from the DOS command line. The syntax is:

        REJECT <WADNAME> <MAPNAME> <THRESHOLD>

    Where: 
       <WADNAME>   = Name of the WAD file to process. Don't add .WAD onto 
                     the end of the name.
       <MAPNAME>   = The map name to modify. REJECT will only process one
                     map at a time so if you have more than one map in your 
                     WAD then you need to REJECT multiple times.
                     DOOM 1 & DOOM 2 use different naming conventions for
                     map names. If you are using a DOOM1 wad file use the 
                     format ExMy where x and y are the Episode number and 
                     Map number respectively. DOOM2 map names are constructed
                     thus: MAPxx where xx is the map number from 01 to 32. 
       <THRESHOLD> = The distance at which sectors are rejected. See next 
                     section for explanation of this parameter.
         

    eg: reject mywad1 e1m1 600

        or

        reject mywad2 map01 600


    NOTE: REJECT writes back to the original wad so make a backup
    before using. Having said that it hasn't corrupted any of the wads
    I've tried it on.

    Both DEU and BSP will overwrite the reject table in a wad file so run
    REJECT *AFTER* you run either of these utilities. I use a simple batch
    file to control the edit/run cycle:

        deu
        bsp mywad.wad
        reject tmp e1m1 600
        doom -file tmp.wad


    If you want it to dump a load of debug info use the DOS command 

        SET DEBUG_DEVICE=REJECT.LOG

    will dump into the file REJECT.LOG which you may (or may not)
    find interesting. :->


6.0 Operation
-------------

    REJECT works by reading the map specified and creating a list of all
    the sectors which exist in the map. It then takes each sector in turn 
    and compares the distance of all the other sectors. If this distance 
    is less the THRESHOLD parameter the the sector is 'ACCEPTED' in the 
    reject table. If the distance is greater than the THRESHOLD parameter    
    then the sector is 'REJECTED' and DOOM will not perform line of sight 
    calculations for that sector thereby speeding up the operation of DOOM.

    The exact value of the THRESHOLD varies greatly from WAD to WAD but
    start by using 600 and see if the game play is acceptable.
