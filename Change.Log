  - new release build 490 with better UNIX support.

Sun Oct 1 17:23:52 2000		<um@compuserve.com>

* general
  - modified makefiles so that vanilla UNIX make can be used. everything
    other than deutex/deusf now can be build with vanilla UNIX make.
  - documentation work here and there.

* idbsp
  - fixed a bug in makefile.

* slige
  - fixed some warnings.

* reject
  - fixed the broken comments, use plain C++ style comments so that
    C++ compilers like cfront won't get confused.
  - still included another copy of the GPL, removed, is in doc directory.
  - fixed manual page.

* wadgc
  - changed prototypes from K&R to ANSI style and fixed compiler warnings.

  - added the new XDoom 5001/5002 thingies, wind/current.
  - added hotkeys to show/hide things, vertices and line arrowheads.
  - modified options so that editor comes up not showing vertices
    and line arrows, faster and one might want to look at the map only
    and not edit it.
  - added a menu to set the zoom factor, so that one won't have to step
    through all scales. made it tear-off menu too, so that it can be placed
    as toolbox besides the editor main window.
  - added -title to tear-off menus, so that a default title like "tearoff1"
    won't be used.
  - added a menu to set the grid size, so that one won't have to step
    through all sizes. made it tear-off menu too, so that it can be placed
    as toolbox besides the editor main window.

  - set lib directory dependend on platform for UNIX and Windows.
  - added some generic engine option to options menu, engine shell wrappers
    adjusted appropriate too.
  - added new linedefs for XDoom/XDoomPlus.
  - under Windows texture names in the wall texture picker dialog weren't
    fully readable, somehow the grid manager calculates the necessary
    width of a listbox wrong under Windows. Made it wide enough so that
    texture names are readable under Windows too.
  - if user nuked linedef type dialogs program puked, fixed this bug.
  - also added cancel button to linedef type dialogs, more consistent.
  - same for sector type dialog, puked if nuked, fixed and cancel button

  - corrected several thing height/radius in the things.lst files
    for Doom, Doom][, XDoom and XDoomPlus.

* bsp
  - fixed more EGCS warnings.
  - merged with the features and bugfixes of bsp included in Yadex.
  - raised version number to 4.0, this definitely is not bsp23x anymore
    and there is a 3.0 release without sources floating arround.

* acc
  - for loops working now.

* lib
  - integrated Andre's my_getopt, better for portability because we
    don't have to depend on a getopt in libc anymore.

* multigen
  - added documentation about the broken code in original Doom sources
    for number of sprites calculation. Not multigen needs to be fixed,
    but the broken code in r_things.c.

* listacs
  - new tool to disassemble ACS object code, written by Randy Heit.

* dm2au
  - new tool written by Sam Lantinga to extract sfx data from WAD's as
    Sun Ulaw audio format, suitable for cat >/dev/audio.

* general
  - better copyright text for sources I wrote.
  - removed the multiple copies of GNU license, one copy is left
    in doc directory, go read there.
  - overworked all manual pages, they format better now with V7 formatters.

Mon Nov  1 22:32:12 1999	<um@compuserve.com>

* raw2ppm
  Andre Majorel has hacked this program, so that it can handle graphics
  from the Alpha Doom releases.

* deutex
  - new release 4.0.3, fixes some minor problem.

    least compiler doesn't get stuck anymore.

* library
  The palette.c file now includes the palettes from Alpha Doom releases,
  extracted by Andre Majorel. Right now only raw2ppm uses this palettes,
  but other tools could be improved to make use of them too, if needed.

* various
  - forgot to create man1 directory in the Windows makefile, fixed.
  - several other modifications in makefiles.

Mon Sep 27 04:54:25 1999	<um@compuserve.com>

* general
  Most tools are big endian fixed and tested now, thanks to
  Oliver Kraus (olikraus@yahoo.com).

* wadtex
  - can decompile textures now build from some patches in the PWAD and some
    in the IWAD.

* slige
  - integrated new build 464, has a config file and some other improvements.
  - also is big endian fixed, thanks to Oliver Kraus.

* tkwadcad
  - the documentation is lagging much behind the code, worked a bit on it
    to catch up.

* wadldc
  - bug fix from Oliver Kraus for big endian.

* deutex/deusf
  - new, integrated release 4.0.2 from Andre Majorel.

* lib
  - print file name which open_wad() can't open.

* various
  - copy manual pages under Windows to c:\man\man6 with 'make install'.
  - added cawf to support directory, is faster than awf, but more picky.
  - wrote man command for Windows/Cygwin.

Mon Aug 16 05:54:43 1999	<um@compuserve.com>

* acc
  - commented out byte order options, use BIGEND define from Makefile
    and compile program using the correct byte order for the host. Also
    fixed all makefiles using the byte order option in xwadtools and
    xdoom.
  - don't use .o as default extension for object files, use .aco.
  - implemented #include <...> and #include "..." properly, so that
    it is not necessary anymore, to have the game includes in the
    PWAD project directory. Fixed the include files for Hexen and
    XDoom appropriate and modified the Makefiles for Hexen and
    XDoomPlus to use the improved acc.
  - didn't compile with DJGPP under DOS, fixed and tested a bit too.
  - updated manual page.

* tkwadcad
  - added special activation "use and passthrough" to line special list
    for XDoomPlus/ZDoom.
  - overworked thing editor dialog. now it allows to enter a thing type
    too, not just selection from the list. this allows to enter things
    not defined in the thing list. also it won't fail on unknown things
    anymore, the listbox has a new entry UNKNOWN, which is handled special.
  - same for sector type selection, added UNKNOWN to the listbox, which
    is handled special.
  - also linedef type selection has an entry UNKNOWN now, which is handled
    special.
  - for XDoomPlus and ZDoom added the block everything flag to the linedef
    flags.
  - the linedef type picker dialog showed Doom style informations for the
    linedef types, also for maps in Hexen format. This is fixed, wrote
    new dialog and support functions for Hexen style maps.
  - for that the function reading in linedef.lst also needed to be modified
    to be game type aware, so that it handles the different arguments
    correct.
  - added support for local sprite textures, sprites can be merged in from
    PWAD's with all Boom like corrected Doom engines. Filename can either
    be local and then the sprite name, or the thing can be assigned a
    file different from the sprite name in ~/.textures. The .textures file
    got sections now, for the various different graphic resources.
  - added support for local flat textures, those can be merged in from PWAD's
    too with most Doom engines.
  - added option -debug for Windows to show the console for debugging.
  - sort the engines list.
  - fixed the help texts for Windows, fixed system fonts don't work, use
    Courier for the texts.
  - moved GUI stuff to the end of the source, so that GUI comes up after
    options were checked.
  - moved selection for node builder and WAD engine into cascade menus
    of option menu, dialogs for both removed.
  - added option "Show Things", which allows to display things or not.
    helps a lot in packed areas on the map and vertices often are overlaid
    with things and one couldn't get at them, without moving the thing.
    Now one can...
  - added option "Show Vertices", similar to show things. Also this draws
    vertices on top of everything, helpfull to get at vertices in packed
    areas.
  - added options "Show Arrows", which allows to display lines with
    arrow head and without.
  - more different colors for lines to show trigger lines.
  - added button to goto player1 start in toolbox.

* wadgc
  - modified so that sprites are written between S_START and S_END markers,
    all bug fixed engines can handle this.
  - now with flats, sprites and textures used in some PWAD's the problems
    are sorted out. Updated manual page so that it is correct with regards
    to what has been tested.

* idbsp
  - overworked the whole sources, reformatted and Objective-C and other
    uninteresting fragments removed for better readability.
  - added support to read map files in Doom format directly.
  - added support to read map files in Hexen format directly.
  - added option to suppress splitting of lines.
  - added option for quiet processing.
  - added option to insert BEHAVIOR resource into Hexen style WAD's.
  - renamed wad_dwd to waddwd, easier to type etc.
  - overworked the manual pages.
  - overworked all Makefiles in xwadtools and xdoom for usage with the new
    idbsp. For maps in extended Hexen format two Makefiles are provided now,
    one for node building with warm, one for idbsp.

* warm
  - fixed some warnings about possible ambiguous else's, newer EGCS releases
    are more picky about this.

* reject
  - fixed a few remaining warnings about signed/unsigned comparisons.
  - fixed further so that is also compiles with Cfront C++ compiler, tested
    with Cfront 3.0.2 on a OpenServer5 system.
  - some minor modifications of manual page.

* slige
  - modified slidbsp.sh to use the MAP format instead of DWD format.
    Faster processing and probably will avoid problems too.
  - some minor modifications of manual page.

* examples
  - worked a bit on compland.wad and threw out that yuckie Doom plants. I
    used good looking plants from another Doom2 PWAD instead, where the
    author allows usage of his textures. Also made a marble texture rendered
    with povray and used it for a well. The outdoor areas in this level
    look much nicer now, but more essential, the example shows how to add
    sprites and flats to a PWAD for bug fixed engines. Tested if the PWAD
    plays with original Doom][ and Doom95 if merged with DeuSF, works OK.

Tue Jul 20 16:35:39 1999	<um@compuserve.com>

* slige
  replaced release 426 with new release 449.

* wadldc
  - Added support for Hexen, also works with ZDoom PWAD's.
  - Added new option -g <game>, so that it can write the game type into
    LEVEL_START. If this option is not used assume Doom2. Manual page updated.

* wadlc
  - Raised size of the arrays for things, linedefs... to the max possible
    sizes.
  - Fixed warning from GNU C/EGCS.
  - Added support for Hexen, also works with ZDoom PWAD's.
  - Documented additional Hexen map format in manual page.
  - Read in and ignore new game type field in LEVEL_START, updated manual page.

* tkwadcad
  - added selection widget to select type of map.
  - use the new third argument in LEVEL_START now, to differ between
    standard Doom maps and extended Hexen maps.
  - modified things map read routine to differ between standard Doom maps and
    extended Hexen maps.
  - modified editor internal representation of things to the Hexen extended
    format and adjusted all code appropriate. now the editor displays things
    at the correct location in Hexen and ZDoom maps, nice.
  - ZDoom and Hexen maps are populated with things we have no clue about yet.
    the routine trying to display thing images was not prepared for the
    situation and barfed, fixed it.
  - modified linedef read routine too, for reading both map format types,
    internal data representation for linedefs always will be extended format.
  - modified map write routines, so that both map format types can be written.
  - modified the scripts mkflatlst and mktexlst to include the filename of
    the texture in the list. with that done the editor now can show a texture,
    which is in a file with the filename != texturename. Modified the local
    project texture files for compland.wad and all PWAD examples included in
    XDoom appropriate.
  - Added Hexen to the supported games, created flats and texture lists
    from hexen.wad. Typed in sectors and things lists from Hexen Specs.
  - Thing colors in Hexen maps were all wrong, because the routine deciding
    the color was hardcoded for Doom things. Modified, it uses the thing
    class now from things.lst. That didn't work great with Hexen, because
    the game type was set to Doom or Doom2 by the read routine. Added another
    field to LEVEL_START, which must be the game the map is for. If the
    field is missing assume Doom2.
  - Added game type field to all example maps here and in XDoom.
  - The default textures and thing for inserting stuff into a map was all
    setup for Doom. That caused problems with Hexen maps of course. Now
    proper initialization of the defaults is done, based on the game.
  - Typed in linedef list from Hexen Specs. Tested sector, linedef and
    thing list with reference checker on various decompiled Hexen maps,
    lists seem to be OK so far.
  - Show texture image now too in the image info widget, user customizable
    with checkbutton.
  - Modified thing editor dialog, so that is can edit extended Hexen maps too.
  - The background color for the image canvases was setup for the Doom
    transparent color. Hexen uses another color, so configure background
    color for the canvases dependend on the game.
  - Modified the teleport exit class in things.lst for Doom, Doom2 and XDoom
    to class player. So they will show with player color things in the editor,
    same as for Hexen. Documentation modified too.
  - Modified line editor dialog, so that it can edit extended Hexen maps too.
  - fixed the problem with running maps from the current directory,
    when a cd in the engine scripts is necessary, to change directory
    to the one with the engine it self. this was never necessary with
    XDoom, it runs from any directory, but it is not the case with
    lxdoom and Linux Hexen. Also the file select box now works better,
    because it never just cointains "." as the current directory, but
    the full pathname.
  - similar problem with make, did only work from current directory.
    tkwadcad now passes the directory with the WAD to the make script,
    so that this script can cd to there and run make.
  - added a prefered WAD engine to the cadconf() array, different for
    Doom and Hexen. Now, when game is selected the run script automatically
    will be set to the prefered engine. Means, it won't try to play
    a Hexen map with XDoom anymore, it uses Linux Hexen now.
  - forgot to set the selection in the new line special select dialog for
    Hexen, fixed.
  - for Doom a callback on a traced variable made sure, that the angle of
    things is in 45 degree steps. this can't be done for Hexen anymore,
    the angle field is abused for the Polyobj id's and so it must be possible
    to set it to anything between 0 and 255. modified traceing of the callback
    so that it won't set the angle to 45 degree steps anymore, also not for
    Doom, odd angles won't hurt.
  - for Hexen the find sector tag function only needs to walk the sectors
    to find an unused tag, lines have no tags in Hexen maps.
  - added XDoomPlus as game, Doom map but in Hexen style format with
    BEHAVIOR script lump.
  - Added ZDoom to the engine list and wrote start script for it, works
    OK under Windows 9x.

* swantbls
   Tool from Jim Flynn to customize switches, animated flats and textures,
   originaly written for Boom by TeamTNT.
   - Integrated into xwadtools.
   - Ported to UNIX.
   - Fixed for big endian.
   - Wrote Makefile and manual page.
   - Tested it out by including the default tables into a PWAD which hasn't
     had this resources so far and played that with Lxdoom under Linux.
     Texture and flat animations still look OK, so I guess it works.
   - More tests done after adding support for loadable tables to XDoom,
     see example PWAD's there, seems to work OK.

* acc
  Hexen "Action Code Script" compiler, or short ACS, copyright by Activision,
  but free for non profit use.
  - Wrote Makefile for GNU make.
  - Integrated into xwadtools.
  - Fixed all GNU C/EGCS compiler warnings.
  - Ported to UNIX.
  - Compiled the included test.acs on various x86 UNIX's and Win 9x and
    compared the resulting object files with one created with acc for DOS,
    compiled by Activison with Watcom C. The object files all are identical,
    so the compiler probably works ok, at least for little endian systems.
  - Wrote manual page.
  - Converted the license document from some funny .doc format into plain
    ASCII text, so that it can be read on any platform.

* lswad
  - made the assumption that a flat is 4096 bytes large. this is not true
    for the water flats in hexen.wad, those are larger for some reason, hm.
    modified so that everything between F_START and F_END with a size > 0
    is listed as flat when used with option -F.

* wadtxls
  - fixed the warning from GNU C/EGCS

* idbsp
  - fixed the warnings from GNU C/EGCS
  - changed radius for point on side check from 2.0 to 1.5, is supposed to
    produce better results sometimes.

* wadgc
  - fixed the warnings from GNU C/EGCS

* reject
  - fixed wrong order warnings in class declarations from GNU C/EGCS

* dmpsmu
  - fixed all warnings from GNU C/EGCS
  - removed string functions and endian support, use those from the
    library instead.

* include files for library:
   - added structures for Hexen lumps to wad.h.
   - added string define for path and extension seperator to sysdep.h

* library:
   - added function check_lump_name(), used to figure if a lump exists.
   - added Hexen BEHAVIOR lump to get_map_lump(), so we can get at this
     one too.

* various:
   - added Raven and Activision to the DISCLAIMER section of manual pages,
     many of the tools work with their games too and no one should bother
     the vendors, if the program won't work correct.
   - Downloaded Hexen Spec and added it to the doc directory, to be able
     to understand the differences in the WAD format and ACS scripts.
     Converted the document from some funny .doc format into plain ASCII text,
     so that it can be read on any platform.
   - borrowed animated computer textures from Kurt Kesler's ZDoom PWAD
     KZDoom1 and included it in compland.wad. This should show how to
     use animated textures in standard Doom2 PWAD's with this tools.
   - Found out what warm didn't like in compland.wad and fixed it, warm
     manual page updated too.
   - Woho, a Hexen PWAD example... I started to write a Hexen PWAD with
     this tools, to see if it works, what is missing and so on.

Thu Jun 24 16:55:25 1999	<um@compuserve.com>

* tkwadcad
  - Linedef files for Doom2 and XDoom had a wrong linedef 85, fixed.
  - Added all the new linedefs for Boom features implemented into the
    linedef file for XDoom.
  - Print the thing type number in the invalid thing type dialog box
    of the thing checker.
  - Modified the scripts to build the texture and flats list with,
    to write the name of the WAD file into the list file, so that
    one knows where it came from.
  - Forgot to set the map modified flag, if a thing is rotated with key
    accelerators, fixed.

* wadpatch
  - New overworked version from Andre Majorel inserted. This one now can
    extract a picture from any lump without looking in PNAMES.

* examples
  - Modified path for doom2.wad in the makefiles to /usr/local/games/xdoom.
  - Modified makefile for the povray rendered textures, so that it leaves
    the rendered true color images to have a look at them. Make clean gets
    rid of them and leaves the quantized images only.

Mon Jun 14 12:55:02 1999	<um@compuserve.com>

* wadgc
  - Modified so that additional texture patches are written between
    PP_START and PP_END markers. This is not necessary for the game
    engines, nor make this tools use of it, but it is a convention
    used by some other tools.
  - Finaly I found the bug why sometimes some colors were wrong in
    imported graphics, while they were correct in the PPM source.
    strncmp() doesn't do the same than memcmp(), the color compare
    function didn't work correct, fixed.
  - Added I_START...I_END section for images in the global namespace
    like title picture, menu pictures...

* raw2sfx
  - New tool to convert 8bit 11kHz raw sound data into id's sfx sound
    format.

* tkwadcad
  - Added the new linedefs for the comm gadget to xdoom linedef file.
  - Added the new linedefs for Boom compatible texture scrollers to
    xdoom linedef file.
  - Made the object infos a bit more decriptive, was to cryptic probably.

* dmpsmu
  - Good tool from Frans P. de Vries for printing level maps in Postscript,
    better than wadps. Also includes another WAD contents analyzer and some
    more. Program can be compiled under DOS and Windows too, but so far
    I have not taken the time to integrate it into the DOS and Windows
    makefiles and try it out.

* wadext
  - Made output pipeable too.

* examples
  - The wadgc input file for compland.wad was missing the y offset for
    the patches in the texture section, doh! Well, offset is 0 so it
    worked without that I noticed it. Fixed.

Sat Jun  5 12:28:49 1999	<um@compuserve.com>

* tkwadcad
  - The line length calculation routine returned the length as a float,
    while other routines expect an integer, fixed.
  - Modified sliding door linedef to 300, was 200 before which is
    used by Boom for something else.
  - Added support for building PWADs with make to the editor. PWADs with
    graphic and sound resources require usage of a bunch of tools and
    that nasty work best is done with make. Plain level maps still can
    be compiled and processed with one of the node builders, same as
    before.
  - Added error message if one tries to run a Doom engine from the
    editor, without any level map loaded.
  - Made canvases showing images sunken, looks nicer.
  - Bound key q to the quit function as accelerator.
  - Added help menu entry. The help functions are implemented in an own
    package, the main program is pretty huge already and keeps growing.
    Also the help package uses its own namespace, to avoid global variable
    conflicts.
  - Modified thing lists, so that a teleport exit will show the green plasma
    fog in the thing image canvas.
  - Bound return key to object properties editor.
  - Implemented rotation of things with accelerator keys.
  - The Tk listbox binding is a bit unusual, replaced the default binding for
    keys Home, End, Prior and Next with a more common functionality. Also the
    listbox by default doesn't get focus, if one clicks with the pointer into
    it. This is modified too, the listboxes now should behave more similar to
    those in other GUI's.
  - Made the help balloons timer controlled, so that they pop up after one
    second. This is a lot less annoying and so I added some more help balloons
    to various dialogs.
  - The filenames for flats, textures and sprites can be lower case now too.
  - Added support into the wall texture picker, to handle project local
    textures in the current directory.
  - Added counter for the number of sidedefs.
  - All 16 bits of the linedef flag can be edited now, to support extensions
    from XDoom and Boom and who knows what else.
  - Moved the linedefs for laser to 32x, the old 20x values collided with
    Boom.
  - Implemented merging of lines, if a vertex connected to two lines is
    deleted.
  - Fixed a bug in the line reference checker, it barfed on checking a map
    with lines but without any sectors.
  - Completely overworked the engine support to get XDoom separated from
    Doom][. Is much easier now too to add support for more engines, Boom
    someday maybe.
  - Implemented flipping of sidedefs.
  - Added the linedef for UAC communication gadget to xdoom linedefs.
  - Worked a bit on the manual.

* idbsp
  - If the output wad already existed, the program asked if it should
    overwrite it. Because I use make to build my WAD's and because I
    don't like such stupid questions from programs, I have deactivated
    this, it just gets into the way if used from make. If no one
    complains I'll not add an option for this, because IMHO it's not
    worth it.

* mkgipal
  - Modified the color string 'Untitled' to the color index number, is
    more comfortable to use in the gimp palette dialog than counting
    rows and columns.

* mkpopal
  - New tool to make a color include file for povray.

* mkqmap
  - New tool to make a color quantization map for ppmquant.

* lswad
  - New version from Andre Majorel inserted, with some new flags to
    control output better than before.

* wadgc
  - Modified so that sprites are written between SS_START and S_END
    markers. With this adding new sprites works and replacing existing
    sprites might work too.

* wadlc
  - New version from Andre Majorel inserted, which does support piped
    input and output too.

* examples
  - Added some new tunes to compland.wad, I can't hear D_RUNNIN anymore.
    Also the example shows how to add new music to PWADs with this tools.
  - Converted Hexen rock textures to the Doom palette with mkqmap and
    ppmquant.  I redesigned some outside area in compland.wad with this new
    textures, looks much better now.
  - Fixed some small glitches in compland.wad, I hadn't noticed before.
  - Overworked the EXAMPLES directory structure some, to keep the various
    examples separated.
  - Worked on povray rendered textures for Doom and included some sources
    in the examples.

Sat Mar 27 11:12:37 1999	<um@compuserve.com>

* general
  - Andre Majorel send me the color palette for Strife extraced from that
    WAD, so I added Strife support to all tools using a color palette.
    Thanks Andre.

* xew
  - it uses the Strife palette from the library now and I deleted the
    included Strife palette. Only an extra palette for Heretic is used
    by this program now localy, I don't know what this one is for.

* wadpatch
  - the color palette was used uninitialized, thanks to Jamie Guinan
    (guinan@bluebutton.com) for the bug report.

* wadtex
  - crashed on very large textures. Fixed by Andre Majorel, it supports
    textures up to 1024x256 now and clips larger textures with a warning.

* wadflat
  - it didn't allow to extract flats from PWADS so far, because PWADS
    cannot include a F_START label. Modified so that the program accepts
    FF_START as start label too, which is used by convention with most
    WAD tools.

Tue Feb 16 12:48:25 1999	<um@compuserve.com>

* general
  - After installing Linux Heretic and Linux Hexen I realized, that this
    tools work to some degree with this games too and they could be improved
    to work fully with all WAD file based games, like Strife, Heretic and
    Hexen. So I felt that the name 'xdoomtools' is not appropriate for this
    tools collection anymore and I renamed it to 'xwadtools', which means
    cross-platform, portable WAD tools.
  - overworked all manual pages, removed references to XDoom and added
    new section 'SUPPORTED GAMES' instead.

* slige
  - integrated new version build 426 from 1999/02/09
  - with the new -nulls option it is much easier now to build nodes
    with WARM, because all necessary lump entries for a map are created
    with this option. So no run through wadldc, wadlc and wadcat necessary
    anymore. So I modified slwarm.sh to reflect this. The complicated
    way still is necessary for IDBSP, but that is fine, this way the
    other tools will be used more and tested more.
  - updated manual page.

* dmtxls
  - renamed to wadtxls, it did support Heretic WAD files already.
  - modified source filenames, comments in sources, makefile, printed
    texts etc. etc. appropriate too.

* doom_ps
  - renamed to wadps, it works to some degree with Heretic WADs too.
  - modified source filenames, comments in sources, makefile, printed
    texts, etc. etc. appropriate too.
  - the program made assumptions about length of pathnames, fixed.

* pal2c
  - new program from scratch, used to extract a color palette from the
    PLAYPAL resource in an IWAD file.

* library
  - renamed doompal.c -> palettes.c and added the palettes from hexen.wad
    and heretic_share.wad extracted with pal2c.

* xew
  - after importing the correct color palettes into the library I deleted
    the wrong palettes for Heretic and Hexen from the sources. It uses
    the correct ones from the library now for this games too.
  - fixed manual page appropriate too.

* wadtext
  - added option to select the used color palette, so the program now
    supports Heretic and Hexen too.
  - increased the largest possible texture to 256x200, this is the size
    of the sky textures used in Hexen.
  - modified manual page appropriate.
  - renamed to wadtex as suggested by Andre Majorel
  - fixed all documentation references to the old name

* wadfext
  - added option to select the used color palette. so that the program
    now supports Heretic and Hexen too.
  - modified manual page appropriate.
  - renamed to wadflat as suggested by Andre Majorel
  - fixed all documentation references to the old name

* wadgc
  - added option to select the used color palette, so that the program
    now supports Heretic and Hexen too.
  - modified manual page appropriate.

* wadpext
  - added option to select the used color palette. so that the program
    now supports Heretic and Hexen too.
  - modified manual page appropriate.
  - renamed to wadpatch as suggested by Andre Majorel
  - fixed all documentation references to the old name

* wadsext
  - added option to select the used color palette. so that the program
    now supports Heretic and Hexen too.
  - modified manual page appropriate.
  - renamed to wadsprit as suggested by Andre Majorel
  - fixed all documentation references to the old name

* mkgipal
  - modified to write the palette to stdout.
  - modified to support palettes for Doom, Heretic and Hexen.
  - added manual page.
  - will be installed from the top level makefile now too.

Thu Feb 11 21:59:47 1999

* tkwadcad
  - added sector height calculator to the sector editor
  - added line length calculator to line editor and line object info
  - added checking of things
  - improved sector checker, it finds invalid types now
  - improved linedef checker, it finds invalid types now

* xew
  - modified to use the Doom color palette from library.

* wadgc
  - modified to use Doom color palette from library.

* wadfext
  - included Andre Majorel's bug fix on STEP1 and the -p option.

* wadtext
  - include Andre Majorel's bug fix that made the first row and column
    appear pink.
  - included Andre Majorel's bug fix for handling of patches with negative
    Y offset.
  - included Andre Majorel's patches for the new options -p, -m and -M.

* wadpext
  - added option -p same as Andre did for wad[ft]ext.

* wadsext
  - added option -p same as Andre did for wad[ft]ext.

* lib
  - included Andre's Doom color palette.
  - included Andre's strlcat() routine.

* various
  - worked over all manual pages to make them more UNIX conformant and
    made them consistent with all patches applied.

Mon Jan 25 17:33:44 GMT 1999

* Tkwadcad
  - added a balloon help widget, I keep forgetting what my abbreviations
    for the linedef flags mean, tee hee.
  - then added balloons to the linedef flags.
  - installation is different now, local files for setup and local PWAD
    resources will be needed soon, wrote new readme and installation hints.
  - we use defined fonts now, so that font size can be configured by user,
    added font size configuration to options menu.
  - implemented change of grid step, bound to keys and from menu.
  - implemented checkbutton in toolbox for snapping on grid.
  - implemented snapping of vertices on grid.
  - implemented snapping of things on grid.
  - implemented snapping of the prefabs on grid.
  - fixed bug in 'save as' function if user aborted.
  - a map filename can be given as argument now, existing or new one.
  - made some dialogs prettier.
  - if the texture picker for sectors or sidedefs is called, display the
    entry in red, so one sees which one is edited.
  - modified flag wasn't set, if left sidedef was removed or added, fixed.
  - splitting of lines bound to keyboard too, manual updated.
  - binding mouse events to entries is not a good idea, it messes up the
    whole event system. Fixed, provided a button for every entry where
    the contents can be selected from some list, that got rid of the
    various problems with event handling.
  - added the find tag button to the linedef tag entry too.
  - added help balloons to both find tag buttons, might not be obvious what
    the buttons do.
  - disabled X selection in the disabled entries in the wall texture picker,
    now the selection on the listbox won't get lost anymore.
  - same for linedef type picker.
  - it was possible to create zero length lines (both vertices the same),
    from the menu and with ctrl-l, fixed. Now with the grid snapping it
    can happen that the vertex snaps to a location, already occupied
    by a vertex, creating a zero length line again, bummer.
  - Implemented deletion of vertices, lines and things with delete key, manual
    updated.
  - The linedef list file had some bugs and the linedef for scrolling textures
    was missing, fixed.
  - Doom does not implement the same linedefs than Doom2, this was wrong.
    After fixing some bugs in the linedefs list I made a correct one for
    Doom from it, by removing the linedefs which were introduced with Doom2.
  - In the things list the ID for the Spider Mastermind was wrong, fixed.
  - The things list had ID and description so far only, I added height,
    radius, name of a sprite and class to the list. This will allow to show
    size boxes for things and the images.
  - Now changed all functions which deal with the things list to the new
    list file format.
  - Added image canvas to the thing editor which shows the sprites, with
    gamma correction, as for the other images too.
  - Added the class, height and radius info from the new thing list format
    into the thing editor.
  - Added a canvas for showing thing images to the toolbox frame too, can
    be activated/deactivated with a checkbutton.
  - Avoided the resizing problem with TK8.0 from Cygnus for Win9x/NT.
    For some reason the height of the drawing canvas widget is ignored
    and the window will initially get the height of the screen. Because
    I set then minimum size of the window to it's intial size, it wasn't
    possible to shrink the window in height. Avoid this for now by using
    a fixed minimum window size, if running under any Windows OS.
  - Switched sectors in info line for linedefs, was right/left instead
    of left/right, is correct now.
  - Vertices, lines, sectors and things are written sorted by name now,
    so that the numbers used in tkwadcad are the same ones, than in tools
    working on binary WAD data. Helps a great deal with using other tools,
    a diff between a map and its backup does work now and this is essential
    for sectors, their order DOES matter.
  - binding events to tk_optionMenu doesn't work under Windows, only under
    UNIX. Modified to trace the variable for writing instead, to execute
    a callback, that works under Windows and UNIX.
  - implemented flipping of lines.
  - wrote checking for unused sectors, usable from new Check menu.
  - wrote function to remove all unused vertices, usable from vertices menu.
    This gets rid of all the unneeded vertices node builders put into the
    maps, which is annoying if one edits a map decompiled from a WAD file.
  - wrote consistency checker for lindef/sidedef references, usable from
    Check menu.
  - wrote consistency checker for tags, usable from Check menu.
  - added support for new thing flags "not cooperative" and "not deathmatch",
    help ballons too. Those are implemented in XDoom, lxdoom and Boom at least.
  - corrected the wrong background color for image canvasas, this came from
    the wrong color palette from xew, now the correct one is used.
  - added support for new lindef flag "translucent", help balloon too. XDoom
    only, Boom uses lindefs for this and I don't like it.
  - added the new linedef types used for lasers in XDoom
  - protected lindef type and sector type pickers against usage with types
    undefined in the configuration files. One still can edit the value
    by hand.

* wadcat
  - written from scratch, for being able to build slige maps with the
    idbsp and warm node builders, but this tool was needed anyway, so
    there.
  - wrote manual page.

* wadsext
  - new tool to extract sprite images from WAD files, I needed that for
    displaying the thing images in tkwadcad.
  - wrote manual page.

* wadpext
  - new tool to extract texture patches from WAD files. Not used yet, but
    now I can start writing a texture editor sometime.
  - wrote manual page.

* slige
  - added shell scripts to build ready to run PWAD's with bsp, idbsp
    and warm. Nice way to test the tools, I sure love slige.

* wadtext
  - got a new option to write a text file with the texture composition,
    ready to use with wadgc.

* mkxppal
  - a little tool to make a .rc file for xpaint with the Doom color
    palette, so that one can edit PPM images with the correct colors.

* mkgipal
  - same as above but for gimp.

* xew
  - I made the assumption that the color palette from this program is
    correct for Doom, the images looked fine. But not so, the palette
    was slightly off the real Doom palette :( So images couldn't be
    used exported with this tool, to import them into PWAD's again.
    Fixed by using the Doom palette included in wadgc, this one is
    a correct one, err, I hope ...
  - Added option -t. If XPM files are exported the program substituted
    the color 0 from Doom into a transparent color for the desktop. This
    is great for making desktop icons, but the images can't be used without
    pain for PWAD files. I added option -t which tells the program to leave
    all Doom colors alone, when exporting into a XPM file.

* library
  - yup, wrong color palette was used, the one from xew :( Now using the
    hopefully correct one from wadgc.

* various
  - uh oh, forgot a book shelf in the computer lab in the example
    map compland.map, added. Well, some improvements, go have a
    look...

Sun Jan 3 17:29:51 1999

* Tkwadcad
  - allow upper case letters in the Doom engine names, names in the list
    changed to test that, it was a bug.
  - added glDoom to the engine selection.
  - added support for warm node builder.
  - cursor keys bound to scroll the map in the drawing canvas.

* reject
  - renamed the C++ sources to .C and tried compiling them with cfront 3.0,
    no luck yet.

* wadwhat
  - took the DOS conditionals out, so that options are the same as under UNIX.

* mkwad
  - usage of response files wasn't documented, manual page modified and
    put a hint into the usage() function for the program.

* bsp
  - this progress indicator is littering the logs, added option -noprog to
    switch it off. Manual page updated appropriate and the build script for
    tkwadcad modified to use this new option.

* warm
  - integrated into the collection.
  - wrote script for tkwadcad to use warm as node builder.
  - moved macros for byte order support into the sysdep files in the lib.
  - the quiet option wasn't that quiet, modified a bit so that it won't
    litter the log in tkwadcad.
  - wrote manual page.

* slige
  - added to the collection.

* wadtexext
  - renamed to wadtext... DOS... sigh.

* wadflatext
  - renamed to wadfext... DOS... sigh.

* various
  - various changes here and there in the system dependent stuff for
    compiling with DJGPP under DOS.
  - took the awf runs out of the Windows makefile, so that I don't
    have to maintain this for DOS too.
  - had to rename some files, violated the 8.3 DOS filenames, sigh.
  - some bug fixes and changes in the compland.map example.

Sat Dec 19 23:44:05 1998

* Tkwadcad
  - all shell scripts rewritten into plain old Bourne shell and tested with
    bash under Cygwin too.
  - modified so that it can run the scripts under Cygwin now too via bash.
  - node builder selection uses radiobuttons now, running both after each
    other didn't work correct anyway, so got rid of this feature.
  - usage of the reject program integrated if BSP node builder is used.
  - game engine selectable from options, user configurable too.
  - added log for running the PWAD from editor.

* reject
  - modified into ANSI C++, compiles now with GNU C++ 2.7 and 2.8, EGCS,
    Unixware7 C++ and Cygwin EGCS.
  - added it into all top level makefiles.
  - wrote manual page.

* library
  - all OS dependent string functions now in strfunc.[c/h].
  - all other OS dependent stuff for endian, file handling... in
    sysdep.[c/h], that filename endian.h caused problems because
    it exists on Linux systems under /usr/include and the compiler
    is to dumb to differ between "endian.h" and <endian.h>.

* various
  - file INSTALL renamed to INSTALLATION, make install under Windows
    didn't work anymore. Filenames aren't case sensitive under Windows
    and I never ever will get used to the crap as it is.

Mon Dec 14 22:49:40 1998

* Various all over the place to get the tools compiled with the Cygwin
  development system. The changes weren't drastic, this tools are
  pretty good with emulating an UNIX environment under Windows and I
  don't want to bore you with minor details. The major problem was that
  the MS OS's differ between text files and binary files, while UNIX
  doesn't. So most of the work was to find the open() functions in the
  sources, which opened files in the wrong mode for Windows. There you
  go with your CR/LF sh*t Billy, oh well...

* Makefile for Windows written.

* Added awf for formatting the manual pages under Windows. Some UNIX
  systems come without any roff formatter too, if you are using one
  and don't wish to port/compile GNU roff on it, well, use awf, is
  written in awk and should work on any UNIX.


Hm, I forgot to put the timestamp in here, too bad...

* Bugfix for Wadext from Alan Curry

Tue Oct 27 13:17:13 1998

* Tkwadcad
  - bug fixes

  - support to connect two existing vertices with a new line added
* Added idbsp node builder and modified it, so it can handle Doom][ maps too.
  Wrote a README file and manual pages for the thing, more details in there.
* The more progress the tools make, the more progress the example level
  compland.wad makes.
* Added support for Doom WAD files to wadwhat.

Mon Aug 31 16:51:00 1998

* Tkwadcad:
  - bug fixes
  - added script to create the wall texture list from WAD files
  - wall texture picker shows the textures in the canvas now, if one has them
    as ppm files, that is (wadtexext)
  - add/remove things in map
  - added script to create the flat list from WAD files
  - sector editor with canvases showing the flat images
  - started writing user manual, won't be fun to write it all afterwards
* Added option -T to lswad to generate a wall texture list usable for tkwadcad
* Added option -F to lswad to generate a flat list usable for tkwadcad
* Fixed stupid bug in lib function get_lump_by_name()
* Wrote wadtexext to decompile textures into ppm files
* Moved Doom palette into lib, is needed by several tools
* Wrote wadflatext to decompile flats into ppm files
* Wrote raw2ppm to convert raw graphics extracted with wadext into ppm files.
* Modified multigen, so that we have conflict free translucent rendering and
  multiplayer color tables now.

Sat Aug 22 16:21:39 1998

* The example PWAD really sucked. I took the time to align the textures,
  added more realistic lightning and such. Is just a tiny example, but at
  least one can do it right.
* Pre-release of tkwadcad included.
* Added function to the lib, which finds one of the level map lumps for
  a specific map.
* Wrote wadldc, a decompiler which produces map files for level maps from
  existing WAD files for usage with tkwadcad.
* Added option -P to lswad to list contents of the PNAMES lump.

Thu Jul 30 17:24:04 1998

* Added wadgc to the collection, wrote manual page.
* Manual page for xew fixed, no palette file option necessary for
  Doom, Heretic and Hexen graphics, it has builtin palettes for
  those.
* Fixed lswad to use the endian routines, should work on little and
  big endian systems now. Manual page changed too.
* Fixed all library routines to use the endian support. This makes
  mktran working on big endian systems, manual page updated.
* Fixed mkwad to use the endian routines, should work on little and
  big endian systems now. Manual page fixed too.
* Added id Softwares lib functions cmdlib.c and scriplib.c to the
  library, to be able to build multigen.
* Added multigen to the collection and integrated it. Made sure the
  compiled sources are the same then the distributed ones, functionality
  wise.
* Fixed manual page for bsp, it doesn't build the reject map, it
  only includes an empty one into the wad.
* All manual pages spell corrected.

Sun Jun 21 14:00:02 1998

* Ops, implemented a bug in the endian support routines, fixed.
* Added support for Doom][ levels to wadlc, manual page updated too.

Sun Jun 21 04:45:39 1998

* Boh, I'm up and running with enough tools now to build WAD files
  completely under UNIX, so it's about time to add a ChangeLog
  for the tools collection.
